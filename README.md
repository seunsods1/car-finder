# 🚗 Car Finder

A Machine Learning-powered web app that lets users upload a photo of a vehicle and returns:
- Vehicle details (make, model, year)
- The cheapest place to buy it online (via external APIs)
- A summary generated by an LLM for vehicle highlights or pricing options

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Vehicle recognition from uploaded images using a pretrained ML model (e.g., YOLOv8, ResNet)
- 🧠 Natural language summaries using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
- 🔗 Integration with vehicle data APIs (e.g., CarsXE or similar)
- 🖼️ Frontend image upload interface (React or Django templates)
- ⚙️ REST API backend built with Django & Django REST Framework
- 🐳 Dockerized for local development and deployment

## 🧪 How It Works

1. 📷 **User uploads an image** of a vehicle.
2. 🧠 **ML model classifies** the vehicle (e.g., Honda Accord 2020).
3. 🌐 **API call** fetches vehicle details and pricing.
4. 🗣️ **LLM generates a summary** of what was found.
5. ✅ Results are returned in a clean, user-friendly UI.
